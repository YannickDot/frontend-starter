# Frontend-starter
A frontend starter kit that I'll try to keep up to date with the best tech out there. ðŸ¤—


## Install

```sh
npm install -g yarn flow-bin babel-cli eslint
```

And then :

```sh
yarn
``` 

or 

```sh
npm install
``` 

(`yarn` is waaaaaaay faster  ðŸš€ )

```


## Features

This project is already configured with :
