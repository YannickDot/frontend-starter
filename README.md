# frontend-starter
A frontend starter kit that I try to keep up to date. ðŸ¤—


## Install

`npm install -g yarn flow-bin babel-cli eslint`

And then `yarn` or `npm install` (`yarn` is waaaay faster)

## Run

 * `npm start`
 * `npm run start_server`


## Features

This project is already configured with :

  - Webpack 2
  - Live CSS Injection
  - Hot Module Replacement for React
  <!-- - Redux Devtools for Time travel -->
  <!-- - Server-side rendering live-reload -->
  - Static Type checking with FlowType
  - Linting with ESLint
  - ES6+ using Babel 6


  If you want the best developer experience (optional), I suggest you to install ðŸš€ :

  - [Atom Editor](https://atom.io)
  - [Nuclide](http://nuclide.io)
  - [FlowType](http://flowtype.org)

## Build
```npm run build_client:prod```


## TODO
Remaining things to add :

* [Code splitting](http://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html)
* Image optimisation
* Deploy static assets to CDN
* Service worker support
* Server-side rendering with Webpack
* Build and deploy pre rendered page shells
